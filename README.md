# COVID-19 Data Assistant

## **Overview**:
The *COVID-19 Data Assistant* is here to help restaurants, stores, or any type of health organization keep track of
important information about their customers or visitors from that day. Businesses or organizations who use the
*COVID-19 Data Assistant* can store the individual's name, phone number, and the other places
they've been that day. If someone who visited the place or business tested positive for the virus, the business would
be able to contact everyone else who that person may have come in contact with that day. At the end of the day, the
*COVID-19 Data Assistant* prints out a daily log of visitors for the business/organization to keep for their own records.

For my project, I wanted to create something relevant and useful for today's world. With the COVID-19 pandemic affecting
everyone globally, I felt that a data assistant would be incredibly useful for businesses and other organizations to 
effectively track their customers. In the case that someone who visited their business tests positive
for the virus sometime after visiting, they can contact the business owner. With the daily log of visitors, the owner
can then easily find all the people who visited their business that day, so that they can get tested. Overall, this
data manager assistant would help reduce the transmission of COVID-19 by encouraging people to get tested,
even if they are asymptomatic. I was inspired to create the *COVID-19 Data Assistant* after visiting a restaurant where
I was asked to leave my information for this very purpose, and I felt like it was simple yet excellent way to keep track
of all of the business/organization's visitors.
